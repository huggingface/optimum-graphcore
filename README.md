# Optimum Graphcore

ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore is the interface between the ðŸ¤— Transformers library and [Graphcore IPUs](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu).
It provides a set of tools enabling model parallelization and loading on IPUs, training and fine-tuning on all the tasks already supported by Transformers while being compatible with the Hugging Face Hub and every model available on it out of the box.

## What is an Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU)?
Quote from the Hugging Face [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/graphcore#what-is-an-intelligence-processing-unit):
>IPUs are the processors that power Graphcoreâ€™s IPU-POD datacenter compute systems. This new type of processor is designed to support the very specific computational requirements of AI and machine learning. Characteristics such as fine-grained parallelism, low precision arithmetic, and the ability to handle sparsity have been built into our silicon.

> Instead of adopting a SIMD/SIMT architecture like GPUs, Graphcoreâ€™s IPU uses a massively parallel, MIMD architecture, with ultra-high bandwidth memory placed adjacent to the processor cores, right on the silicon die.

> This design delivers high performance and new levels of efficiency, whether running todayâ€™s most popular models, such as BERT and EfficientNet, or exploring next-generation AI applications.

> Software plays a vital role in unlocking the IPUâ€™s capabilities. Our Poplar SDK has been co-designed with the processor since Graphcoreâ€™s inception. Today it fully integrates with standard machine learning frameworks, including PyTorch and TensorFlow, as well as orchestration and deployment tools such as Docker and Kubernetes.

> Making Poplar compatible with these widely used, third-party systems allows developers to easily port their models from their other compute platforms and start taking advantage of the IPUâ€™s advanced AI capabilities.
