# Optimum Graphcore

ü§ó Optimum Graphcore is the interface between the ü§ó Transformers library and [Graphcore IPUs](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu). It provides a set of tools enabling model parallelization and loading on IPUs, training and fine-tuning on all the tasks already supported by Transformers while being compatible with the Hugging Face Hub and every model available on it out of the box.

## What is an Intelligence Processing Unit (IPU)?

Quote from the Hugging Face [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/graphcore#what-is-an-intelligence-processing-unit):

> IPUs are the processors that power Graphcore's IPU-POD datacenter compute systems. This new type of processor is designed to support the very specific computational requirements of AI and machine learning. Characteristics such as fine-grained parallelism, low precision arithmetic, and the ability to handle sparsity have been built into our silicon.

> Instead of adopting a SIMD/SIMT architecture like GPUs, Graphcore's IPU uses a massively parallel, MIMD architecture, with ultra-high bandwidth memory placed adjacent to the processor cores, right on the silicon die.

> This design delivers high performance and new levels of efficiency, whether running today's most popular models, such as BERT and EfficientNet, or exploring next-generation AI applications.
