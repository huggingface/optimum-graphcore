# Quickstart

ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore was designed with one goal in mind: **to make training and evaluation straightforward for any ðŸ¤— Transformers user while leveraging the complete power of IPUs**.

## Installation

To install the latest release of ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore:

```
pip install optimum-graphcore
```

Optimum Graphcore is a fast-moving project, and you may want to install from source.

```
pip install git+https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore.git
```

## Environment setup

You need to have the Poplar SDK enabled to use ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore. Refer to the [Getting Started guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html#getting-started) for your system for details on how to enable the Poplar SDK. Also refer to the [Jupyter Quick Start guide](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/jupyter-notebook-quick-start/en/latest/index.html) for how to set up Jupyter to be able to run notebooks on a remote IPU machine.

## Example scripts and Jupyter notebooks

We have a range of example scripts in [`/examples`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples) and Jupyter notebooks in [`/notebooks`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/notebooks) which you can refer to to see how specific elements of the Optimum Graphcore library are used.


## Using Optimum Graphcore

The main Optimum Graphcore classes are:

- [`IPUTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/trainer#optimum.graphcore.IPUTrainer): This class handles compiling the model to run on IPUs, as well as performing the training and evaluation. Refer to the section on [training](trainer) for more information.
- [`IPUConfig`]: This class specifies attributes and configuration parameters to compile and put the model on the IPU. Refer to the section on [configuration](ipu_config) section for more information.


[`IPUTrainer`] is very similar to the ðŸ¤— Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) class, and you can easily adapt a script that currently uses `Trainer` to make it work with IPUs. You will mostly swap `Trainer` for [`IPUTrainer`]((https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/trainer#optimum.graphcore.IPUTrainer)). This is how most of the [Optimum Graphcore example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples) were adapted from the [original Hugging Face](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch) scripts.

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
+from optimum.graphcore import IPUConfig, IPUTrainer, IPUTrainingArguments

-training_args = TrainingArguments(
+training_args = IPUTrainingArguments(
     per_device_train_batch_size=4,
     learning_rate=1e-4,
+    # Any IPUConfig on the Hub or stored locally
+    ipu_config_name="Graphcore/bert-base-ipu",
+)
+
+# Loading the IPUConfig needed by the IPUTrainer to compile and train the model on IPUs
+ipu_config = IPUConfig.from_pretrained(
+    training_args.ipu_config_name,
 )

 # Initialize our Trainer
-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = IPUTrainer(
     model=model,
+    ipu_config=ipu_config,
     args=training_args,
     train_dataset=train_dataset if training_args.do_train else None,
     ...  # Other arguments
```

We also support the `pipeline` API, so you can easily run a model on a given input, for example text image or audio, on IPUs:

```diff
->>> from transformers import pipeline
+>>> from optimum.graphcore import pipeline

# Allocate a pipeline for sentiment-analysis
->>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english")
+>>> classifier = pipeline('sentiment-analysis', model="distilbert-base-uncased-finetuned-sst-2-english", ipu_config = "Graphcore/distilbert-base-ipu")
>>> classifier('We are very happy to introduce pipeline to the transformers repository.')
[{'label': 'POSITIVE', 'score': 0.9996947050094604}]
```
