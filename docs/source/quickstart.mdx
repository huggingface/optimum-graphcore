# Quickstart

ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore was designed with one goal in mind: **making training and evaluation straightforward for any ðŸ¤— Transformers user while leveraging the complete power of IPUs.**

There are two main classes one needs to know:

- [`IPUTrainer`]: the trainer class that takes care of compiling the model to run on IPUs, and of performing training and evaluation, check [here](trainer) for more information..
- [`IPUConfig`]: the class that specifies attributes and configuration parameters to compile and put the model on the device, check [here](ipu_config) for more information.

The [`IPUTrainer`] is very similar to the [ðŸ¤— Transformers Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer), and adapting a script using the `Trainer` to make it work with IPUs will mostly consists of simply swapping the `Trainer` class for the [`IPUTrainer`] one. That's how most of the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples) were adapted from their [original counterparts](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/tree/master/examples/pytorch).

```diff
-from transformers import Trainer, TrainingArguments
+from optimum.graphcore import IPUConfig, IPUTrainer, IPUTrainingArguments

-training_args = TrainingArguments(
+training_args = IPUTrainingArguments(
     per_device_train_batch_size=4,
     learning_rate=1e-4,
+    ipu_config_name="Graphcore/bert-base-ipu",  # Or any other IPUConfig on the Hub or stored locally
+)
+
+# Loading the IPUConfig needed by the IPUTrainer to compile and train the model on IPUs
+ipu_config = IPUConfig.from_pretrained(
+    training_args.ipu_config_name if training_args.ipu_config_name else model_args.model_name_or_path,
 )

 # Initialize our Trainer
-trainer = Trainer(
+trainer = IPUTrainer(
     model=model,
+    ipu_config=ipu_config,
     args=training_args,
     train_dataset=train_dataset if training_args.do_train else None,
     ...  # Other arguments
```
