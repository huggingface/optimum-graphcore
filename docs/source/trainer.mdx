# Training, Evaluation and Prediction

The [`IPUTrainer`] class provides a similar API to the 🤗 Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) class to perform training, evaluation and prediction on Graphcore's IPUs. It is the class used in all the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples).

Compared to the 🤗 Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) class, to instantiate a [`IPUTrainer`] you need to create:
  - An instance of [`IPUTrainingArguments`], which allows you to customize the behaviour of the trainer
  - An instance of [`IPUConfig`], which defines IPU-specific parameters

### IPUSeq2SeqTrainer

The [`IPUSeq2SeqTrainer`] class is used to train seq2seq models. Its behaviour is exactly the same as [`IPUTrainer`] except that it expects [`IPUSeq2SeqTrainingArguments`] instead of [`IPUTrainingArguments`].
