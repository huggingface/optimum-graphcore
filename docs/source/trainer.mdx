# Training, Evaluation and Prediction

The [`IPUTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/trainer#optimum.graphcore.IPUTrainer) class provides a similar API to the ðŸ¤— Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) class to perform training, evaluation and prediction on Graphcore's IPUs. It is the class used in all the [example scripts](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples).

Compared to the ðŸ¤— Transformers [Trainer](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/trainer) class, to instantiate [`IPUTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/trainer#optimum.graphcore.IPUTrainer) you need to create:
  - An instance of [`IPUTrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/trainer#optimum.graphcore.IPUTrainingArguments), which allows you to customize the behaviour of the trainer
  - An instance of [`IPUConfig`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/ipu_config#optimum.graphcore.IPUConfig), which defines IPU-specific parameters

There is an equivalent [`IPUSeq2SeqTrainer`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/trainer#optimum.graphcore.IPUSeq2SeqTrainer) class for seq2seq models which requires you to define:
  - An instance of [`IPUSeq2SeqTrainingArguments`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/trainer#optimum.graphcore.IPUSeq2SeqTrainingArguments)
  - An instance of [`IPUConfig`](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/graphcore/ipu_config#optimum.graphcore.IPUConfig)

## Examples of use

Most example scripts in [`/examples`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/examples) and Jupyter notebooks in [`/notebooks`](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/tree/main/notebooks) use `IPUTrainer` and `IPUTrainingArguments`.


To see how to use `IPUSeq2SeqTrainer` and `IPUSeq2SeqTrainingArguments` look at:

* Jupyter notebooks
  * [Summarization on IPUs - Fine-tuning](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/blob/main/notebooks/summarization.ipynb)
  * [Translation on IPUs - Fine-tuning](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/blob/main/notebooks/translation.ipynb)
