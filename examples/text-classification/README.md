# Text classification examples

## GLUE tasks

Based on the script [`run_glue.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/master/examples/pytorch/text-classification/run_glue.py).

Fine-tuning the library models for sequence classification on the GLUE benchmark: [General Language Understanding
Evaluation](https://gluebenchmark.com/). This script can fine-tune any of the models on the [hub](https://huggingface.co/models)
and can also be used for a dataset hosted on our [hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets) or your own data in a csv or a JSON file
(the script might need some tweaks in that case, refer to the comments inside for help).

GLUE is made up of a total of 9 different tasks. Here is how to run the script on one of them:

```bash
export TASK_NAME=sst2

python run_glue.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-cased \
  --ipu_config_name Graphcore/bert-base-ipu \
  --task_name $TASK_NAME \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --max_seq_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 8 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --output_dir ./output/$TASK_NAME/
```

where task name can be one of cola, sst2, mrpc, stsb, qqp, mnli, qnli, rte, wnli.

The following example fine-tunes BERT on the `imdb` dataset hosted on our [hub](https://huggingface.co/datasets):

```bash
python run_glue.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-cased \
  --ipu_config_name Graphcore/bert-base-ipu \
  --dataset_name imdb  \
  --do_train \
  --do_predict \
  --max_seq_length 128 \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 2e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 3 \
  --output_dir ./output/imdb/
```

## XNLI

Based on the script [`run_xnli.py`](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/examples/pytorch/text-classification/run_xnli.py).

[XNLI](https://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/xnli/) is a crowd-sourced dataset based on [MultiNLI](http://www.nyu.edu/projects/bowman/multinli/). It is an evaluation benchmark for cross-lingual text representations. Pairs of text are labeled with textual entailment annotations for 15 different languages (including both high-resource language such as English and low-resource languages such as Swahili).

#### Fine-tuning on XNLI

This example code fine-tunes mBERT (multi-lingual BERT) on the XNLI dataset.

```bash
python run_xnli.py \
  --model_name_or_path bert-base-multilingual-cased \
  --ipu_config_name Graphcore/bert-base-ipu \
  --language de \
  --train_language en \
  --do_train \
  --do_eval \
  --per_device_train_batch_size 32 \
  --learning_rate 5e-5 \
  --num_train_epochs 2.0 \
  --max_seq_length 128 \
  --output_dir ./output/xnli/ \
  --save_steps -1
```

<!-- TODO: insert accuracy
Training with the previously defined hyper-parameters yields the following results on the **test** set:

```bash
acc = 0.7093812375249501
```
