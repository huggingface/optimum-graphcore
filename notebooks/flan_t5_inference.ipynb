    "Ultra-large language models like GPT3 and GPT4 are undoubtedly impressive and represent important advances in the field of generative AI. However, models of this scale aren't necessary to perform many NLP workloads in production today. Many commercial applications simply don't require such a broad range of generative capabilities and using them may be AI overkill. Here are a few of the issues with using (sometimes) excessive models:\n",
    "- You pay more. These models must be executed on additional GPUs which is reflected in the bill from your cloud compute provider.\n",
    "- The most advanced GPU-based systems, which are required to run these models (A100 and H100), are in high demand and short supply, increasing the cost further.\n",
    "- There is a greater environmental impact due to the high power requirements to both operate and cool these additional GPUs.\n",

    "In December 2022 Google published [Scaling Instruction-Finetuned Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.11416) in which they perform extensive fine-tuning for a broad collection of tasks across a variety of models (PaLM, T5, U-PaLM). Part of this publication was the release of Flan-T5 checkpoints, \"which achieve strong few-shot performance\" with relatively modest parameter counts \"even compared to much larger models\" like the largest members of the GPT family.\n",

    "In this notebook we will demonstrate how you can use Flan-T5 on readily available IPU-POD4s (Flan-T5-Large) and IPU-POD16s (Flan-T5-XL) for common NLP workloads. We shall do this by considering the following questions:\n",
