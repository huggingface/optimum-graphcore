    "\n",
    "🤗 Optimum Graphcore is the interface between the [🤗 Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [Graphcore IPUs](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu).\n",
    "It provides a set of tools enabling parallelization and loading of models on IPUs, training and fine-tuning on all the tasks already supported by 🤗 Transformers while being compatible with the 🤗 Hub and every model available on it out of the box.\n",
    "\n",

    "Quote from the Hugging Face [blog post](https://huggingface.co/blog/graphcore#what-is-an-intelligence-processing-unit):\n",
    ">IPUs are the processors that power Graphcore’s IPU-POD data center compute systems. This new type of processor is designed to support the very specific computational requirements of AI and machine learning. Characteristics such as fine-grained parallelism, low-precision arithmetic, and the ability to handle sparsity have been built into the silicon.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Instead of adopting a SIMD/SIMT architecture like GPUs, Graphcore’s IPU uses a massively parallel, MIMD architecture, with ultra-high bandwidth memory placed adjacent to the processor cores, right on the silicon die.\n",
    "\n",
    "> This design delivers high performance and new levels of efficiency, whether running today’s most popular models, such as BERT and EfficientNet, or exploring next-generation AI applications."

    "### BERT\n",
    "\n",
    "BERT fine-tuning is when you train a BERT model on a supervised learning task on a relatively small amount of data, by using starting weights obtained from pre-training on a large, generic text corpus. Pre-training of BERT requires a lot of unlabelled data (for instance all of Wikipedia + thousands of books) and a lot of compute. It is expensive and time-consuming, but after pre-training, BERT will have learned an extremely good language model that can be fine-tuned on downstream tasks with a small amount of labelled data, achieving great results.\n",

    "In this notebook, we will fine-tune BERT (pre-trained on IPUs with the Wikipedia dataset) on a question answering task called SQuAD. Then we will perform inference on the accompanying validation dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is SQuAD?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Stanford Question Answering Dataset (SQuAD) is a reading comprehension dataset, consisting of questions posed by crowdworkers on a set of Wikipedia articles, where the answer to every question is a segment of text, or span, from the corresponding reading passage, or the question might be unanswerable.\n",
    "\n",
    "From https://rajpurkar.github.io/SQuAD-explorer/\n",
    "\n",
    "Basically you train a model to take a question and read a passage of text and predict the start and end positions of where that answer lies in the passage. The image below shows an example from the dataset:\n",

    "The model layers are split over 4 IPUs. We then use [*pipeline parallelism*](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/tf-model-parallelism/en/latest/pipelining.html) over the IPUs with gradient accumulation. We subdivide the compute batch into micro-batches that pass through the pipeline in the forward pass and then come back again in the backwards pass, accumulating gradients for the parameters as they go.\n",
    "\n",
    "A complete pipeline step has a ramp-up phase at the start and a ramp-down phase at the end. Increasing the gradient accumulation factor increases the total batch size and also increases the pipeline efficiency, and therefore throughput, because the proportion of time in ramp-up/down phases will be reduced. \n",

    "An IPU-POD4 contains 4 IPUs and our pipeline is 4 IPUs long, therefore we cannot replicate the pipeline. If we were running on an IPU-POD16, then we could utilise replication by feeding four different micro-batches to the device, which quadruples the effective mini-batch size. We call this configuration a \"4x4 pipeline\".\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Recomputation checkpoints\n",
    "\n",
    "We can make more efficient use of the valuable In-Processor-Memory by saving only selected activation inputs and recomputing the rest. This lets us optimise on memory savings (by not storing all activations) vs FLOP expenditure (by not having to recompute all activations). \n",
