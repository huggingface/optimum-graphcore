    "# Machine Translation on IPUs using MT5 - Fine-tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "[MT5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/MT5) is the multilingual variant of [T5](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/t5), an encoder-decoder transformer model that leverages a unified text to text approach to represent natural language tasks. A limitation of T5 is that pre-trained checkpoints primarily support only English as the source text for any natural language task so the majority of problems that T5 can solve are English to English tasks. MT5 uses the same architecture as T5 but the encoder is pre-trained on a dataset covering 101 languages. However, unlike T5, MT5's pre-training does not include any supervised training so the MT5 pre-trained checkpoints have limited immediate use. To be performant on any downstream task like machine translation or sentiment analysis, MT5 needs to be fine-tuned.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fine-tuning MT5 is similar to fine-tuning T5 (see Summarization on IPU using T5 Small - Fine-Tuning `summarization.ipynb`). However, since MT5 uses a much larger vocabulary than T5, this needs to be accounted for when placing MT5 on the IPU. This notebook shows how to:\n",
    "- Fine-tune MT5 using the Graphcore IPU with the `IPUSeq2SeqTrainer` for the task of machine translation with a source language that is different from English.\n",
    "- (optional) Place large layers such as an embedding table or projection layer across IPUs when they do not fit on a single IPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will use the [WMT dataset](http://www.statmt.org/wmt16/), a machine translation dataset composed of a collection of various sources, including news commentaries and parliament proceedings."

    "footprint is required. To do so, firstly note that `mt5-small` has 300M parameters. If we choose to use mixed precision training, we can obtain a partial approximation for the memory footprint by considering the memory required to store the model weights and gradients (see\n",

    "Excluding the memory requirements for other aspects such as optimizer states, activations, temporary variables and model code to name a few, atleast 2862MB is required to fine-tune `mt5-small`. Since a single MK2 IPU has 900MB of SRAM, we need atleast 4 IPUs to hold the model in memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "To decide on how to place the constituent layers of `mt5-small` on the IPU, observe that the official configuration of `mt5-small` can be summarized as consisting of:\n",
    "\n",
    "- An input embedding table of size (250112 x 512)\n",
    "- 8 Encoder layers\n",
    "- 8 Decoder layers\n",
    "- A language modelling head or linear projection layer with weights of size (250112 x 512). Note that by default input and output embeddings are _not_ tied for MT5 so the linear projection layer has a separate set of weights. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since the input embedding table and output projection layer each use approximately 128M parameters when weights are _not_ tied, we can try to reserve IPU-0 and IPU-3 for these layers and split the 16 encoder and decoder layers equally across IPU-1 and IPU-2. This configuration can be specified in the `IPUConfig` via `layers_per_ipu:=[0, 8, 8, 0]` where the value 0 is used to reserve specific IPUs for non-transformer layers. For MT5 in Optimum Graphcore this translates to placing the embedding table and language modelling head on the first and last IPUs respectively. However if we choose to tie input and output embedding weights, we no longer need to reserve the last IPU for the language modelling head as it can be placed on IPU-0: `layers_per_ipu:=[0, 8, 4, 4]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we construct the `IPUConfig` by simply setting `ipu_config=IPUConfig(layers_per_ipu=[0, 8, 8, 0])` and proceeding with defining the `IPUSeq2SeqTrainer` as done in the [Fine-tuning the model](#fine_tuning_the_model) section above, unfortunately the model will not compile due to an Out of Memory error. To understand why the model does not fit, the [PopVision Graph Analyser](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/graphcore-popvision-user-guide/en/2.0.0/popvision.html) (see getting started [video](https://share.vidyard.com/watch/jbEaiQqkEinNnFBBFwEHNV)) can be used to analyse the memory footprint. A summary of the memory use per IPU is shown below: \n",
    "\n",
    "![image-2.png](images/mt5_oom.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be seen that IPU-0 and IPU-3 exceed the max memory permitted. For cases like the above, it is typically due to the embedding weights being large and the corresponding weight update process being expensive. For example if we use the AdamW optimiser, an additional 8 bytes * 250112 * 512 = 977MB of memory is required during the update step of the parameters on IPU-0 and IPU-3 since the AdamW optimiser uses additional state parameters. If the choice of optimiser cannot be changed, the optimiser states can be chosen to be placed off chip in the [IPU Gateway DRAM](https://docs.graphcore.ai/projects/ipu-programmers-guide/en/latest/about_ipu.html) by setting the option `optimizer_state_offchip=True` in the `IPUConfig`, reducing the memory used on the IPU during the forward pass. However when updating the large embedding weights during the backwards pass, the optimiser states for the embeddings will still need to be moved to the IPU and in this case they are of size 977MB, exceeding the IPU max memory. The amount of memory moved to the IPU when updating the embedding weights can be reduced if we serialize the computation of the embeddings so that a large embedding computation is split into N sequential sub-embedding computations. By serializing the computation of the embeddings into N parts, the update step for the embeddings in the backwards pass will also be serialised into N parts, meaning only 1/N of the optimiser states for the embeddings need to be moved to the IPU at a given step.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `IPUConfig` provides options to serialize the input embedding table and the computation of the language modelling head via:\n",
    "- `embedding_serialization_factor: int`, for example `embedding_serialization_factor=4` will serialize the input embedding computation into 4 partial calculations.\n",
    "- `projection_serialization_factor: int`\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to serializing the computation of the input embeddings and the projection layer, it is also possible to place the serialized computation across a selection of contiguous IPUs via options below. Note that these options are mutually exclusive with the above options which restrict serializing computations to a single IPU.\n",
    "- `serialized_embedding_splits_per_ipu: List[int]` for instance `serialized_embedding_splits_per_ipu=[3, 1, 0, 0]`, will serialize the embedding computation into 4 parts, with 3 parts occuring on IPU-0 and the last computation on IPU-1. Note that the `list` specifying the number of sub computations to place on each IPU needs to be of the same length as the `layers_per_ipu` parameter introduced above.\n",
    "- `serialized_projection_splits_per_ipu: List[int]` \n",
    "\n",
    "By setting `optimizer_state_offchip=True` and serializing the input and projection layer embeddings, `mt5-small` with the [Graphcore/mt5-small-ipu](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore/mt5-small-ipu) `IPUConfig` can be fine-tuned on the IPU. Other memory management options are available in the `IPUConfig` and can be viewed in the [documentation](https://huggingface.co/docs/optimum/main/graphcore/ipu_config#optimum.graphcore.IPUConfig). With the above information hopefully it is clearer why [Graphcore/mt5-small-ipu](https://huggingface.co/Graphcore/mt5-small-ipu) has particular options enabled. The above information details the memory requirements for fine-tuning `mt5-small`, can you follow a similar process for defining an `IPUConfig` to run `mt5-small` in inference mode (note that inference variants for options like `layers_per_ipu` can be set via `inference_layers_per_ipu`)?\n",
    "- How many IPUs are required to run `mt5-small` in inference mode?\n",
    "- Is it necessary to serialize input embeddings and the projection layer for inference?\n",
    "- If the input and output weight embeddings are tied, is it possible to serialize embedding / projection layer computation?\n",

The effective batch size is also configured by providing arguments to the  `micro_batch_size`, `gradient_accumulation_steps` and `n_ipu` parameters.

To make sure the effective batch size remains the same we adjust gradient accumulation steps to take into account additional training replicas.

To reduce the time to train MT5 for translation we can use data parallel training. To use more than 1 replica more IPUs are required. On Paperspace, this is available using either an IPU-POD16 or a BoW-IPU-POD16. Please contact Graphcore if you need assistance running on larger platforms.\n",
