    "# Zero-Shot Text Classification on IPUs using MT5 - Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows you how to use the multilingual variant of T5, [MT5](https://huggingface.co/models?other=arxiv:2010.11934), for [zero-shot text classification](https://huggingface.co/tasks/zero-shot-classification) in languages other than English on the Graphcore IPU. We use the large configuration of MT5 finetuned on the [XNLI corpus](https://huggingface.co/datasets/xnli) to showcase this. \n",
    "\n",
    "Since MT5 has no sequence classification head, it is currently not compatible with the [zero-shot-classification Huggingface pipelines API](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main/main_classes/pipelines#transformers.ZeroShotClassificationPipeline). We demonstrate explicitly how to perform text-generation in cases like this. The content displayed in this notebook is the same as that shown in the [Alan Turing Institute MT5 large XNLI finetuned zero-shot example](https://huggingface.co/alan-turing-institute/mt5-large-finetuned-mnli-xtreme-xnli) with minor changes for IPU exeuction. \n",
