    "\n",
    "The method used to enable the IPU to use pipelines can even be replicated for other tasks such as sentiment analysis, translation and summarization, meaning that you can get started on any task with hundreds of models available on the [🤗 Models Hub.](https://huggingface.co/models?pipeline_tag=token-classification&sort=downloads).
