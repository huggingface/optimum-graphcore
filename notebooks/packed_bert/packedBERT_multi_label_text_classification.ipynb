    "This notebook builds on the process of fine-tuning BERT on a [text classification task](text_classification.ipynb) showing how to implement packing for BERT for multi-label classification. [Packing](https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-packed-bert-for-2x-faster-training-in-natural-language-processing) is an optimisation method originally used for 2x faster BERT pre-training, which can now also provide massive throughput increases for **fine-tuning** and **batched inference**! \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what *is* packing?** The basic idea of 'packing' a dataset is to utilise the requirement for constant-shaped inputs into a model. Instead of padding it with empty, unused space, we can recycle this unused space and fill it with more inputs! The architecture of transformer models like BERT supports this, and lets us optimally use this space to process multiple sequences within one input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**And here is why you might want to use it:** Having a single input contain multiple sequences leads to multiple sequences being processed in parallel in a single pass within a single iteration inside a batch, increasing the 'effective' batch size of the model by a considerable factor in many cases, and most importantly, increasing model throughput for training and batched inference significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [GoEmotions](https://ai.googleblog.com/2021/10/goemotions-dataset-for-fine-grained.html) dataset will be fine-tuned using packing. This notebook outlines how to easily enable packing for BERT when performing fine-tuning/inference on a text-classification task in 🤗 Optimum, resulting in an impressive 5-9x faster training and inference run-time for the dataset. \n",

    "In order to pack efficiently, we will use a histogram-based algorithm: shortest-pack-first histogram packing (SPFHP) presented in the [blog post](https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-packed-bert-for-2x-faster-training-in-natural-language-processing) adapted from the [blog code](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials/tree/master/blogs_code/packedBERT). The full process of packing the dataset consists of four steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a histogram of the sequence lengths of the dataset.\n",
    "2. Generate the 'strategy' for the dataset using one of the state-of-the-art packing algorithms, which maps out the order and indices of the sequences that need to be packed together.\n",
    "3. Use this strategy to create the actual dataset, concatenating the tokenized features together for each column in the dataset, including the labels.\n",
    "4. Finally, pass these new columns into a custom PyTorch dataset, ready to be passed to the PopTorch dataloader!\n",
    "\n",
    "These steps have been simplified through the easy-to-use `packing_utils` available in Graphcore Optimum. You can simply generate the packed dataset after the usual tokenization and preprocessing by passing all necessary packing configuration to the `PackedDatasetCreator` class, and generate the ready-to-use PyTorch dataset with `.create()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Within the function, there are some column names used by default. The expected default columns for text classification include:\n",
    "* `input_ids`\n",
    "* `attention_mask`\n",
    "* `token_type_ids`\n",
    "* `labels`\n",
    "\n",
    "These should all be generated automatically when tokenizing any classification dataset for BERT. However, the labels key, as it is not encoded, may have a different name. For this dataset, the column key for the labels for this dataset is `labels`, we can pass this to the argument `custom_label_key`, so the class can find our labels. \n",
    "\n",
    "The `PackedDatasetCreator` requires different instantiations for different datasets, so it must be called separately for each of our dataset splits. We can set either `training`, `validation` or `inference` to `True` as needed."
