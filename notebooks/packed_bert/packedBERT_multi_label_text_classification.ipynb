    "This notebook builds on the process of fine-tuning BERT on a [text classification task](text_classification.ipynb) showing how to implement packing for BERT for a new sequence classification task - multi-label classification. [Packing](https://www.graphcore.ai/posts/introducing-packed-bert-for-2x-faster-training-in-natural-language-processing), an optimisation method originally used for 2x faster BERT pre-training, which can now also provide massive throughput increases for **fine-tuning** and **batched inference**! \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what *is* packing?** The basic idea of 'packing' a dataset is to utilise the requirement for constant-shaped inputs into a model. Instead of padding it with empty, unused space, we can recycle this unused space and fill it with more inputs! The architecture of transformer models like BERT supports this, and lets us optimally use this space to process multiple sequences within one input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**And here is why you might want to use it:** Having a single input contain multiple sequences leads to multiple sequences being processed in parallel in a single pass within a single iteration inside a batch, increasing the 'effective' batch size of the model by a considerable factor in many cases, and most importantly, increasing model throughput for training and batched inference significantly.\n",
