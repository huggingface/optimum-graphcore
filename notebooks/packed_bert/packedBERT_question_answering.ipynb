    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how to fine-tune BERT from [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for question-answering using the SQuAD(v1) dataset using [packing](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-packed-bert-for-2x-faster-training-in-natural-language-processing-eadb749962b1), an optimisation method originally used for 2x faster BERT pre-training, which can now also provide massive throughput increases for fine-tuning and batched inference! \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what *is* packing?** The basic idea of 'packing' a dataset is to utilise the requirement for constant-shaped inputs into a model. Instead of padding it with empty, unused space, we can recycle this unused space and fill it with more inputs! The architecture of transformer models like BERT supports this, and lets us optimally use this space to process multiple sequences within one input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**And here is why you might want to use it:** Having a single input contain multiple sequences leads to multiple sequences being processed in parallel in a single pass within a single iteration inside a batch, increasing the 'effective' batch size of the model by a considerable factor in many cases, and most importantly, increasing model throughput for training and batched inference significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process of training and validating the `BertForQuestionAnswering` model requires some adaptations to accommodate a packed dataset, and this notebook aims to introduce these on top of the [existing process](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore/blob/main/notebooks/question_answering.ipynb) for fine-tuning the SQuAD dataset with BERT using an unmodified dataset."

In this notebook, we are using both data parallelism and pipeline parallelism (see this [tutorial](https://github.com/graphcore/tutorials/tree/master/tutorials/pytorch/efficient_data_loading)), so the 'global' batch size, i.e. the number of data elements passed for one gradient calculation on the IPU, is calculated using the `device_iterations`, `gradient_accumulation_steps`, `replication_factor` and `max_seq_per_pack` (maximum sequences in a pack) for training, such that:\n",
