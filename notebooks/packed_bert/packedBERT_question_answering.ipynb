    "# Faster Question-answering on IPU using Packed BERT - Fine-tuning and Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook describes how to fine-tune BERT from [🤗 Transformers](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) for question answering using the SQuAD(v1) dataset using [packing](https://towardsdatascience.com/introducing-packed-bert-for-2x-faster-training-in-natural-language-processing-eadb749962b1), an optimisation method originally used for 2x faster BERT pre-training, which can now also provide massive throughput increases for fine-tuning and batched inference! \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, what *is* packing?** The basic idea of \"packing\" a dataset is to utilise the requirement for constant-shaped inputs into a model. Instead of padding it with empty, unused space, we can recycle this unused space and fill it with more inputs! The architecture of transformer models like BERT supports this, and lets us optimally use this space to process multiple sequences within one input.\n",
    "\n",
    "**And here is why you might want to use it:** Having a single input that contains multiple sequences leads to multiple sequences being processed in parallel in a single pass within a single iteration inside a batch, increasing the \"effective\" batch size of the model by a considerable factor in many cases, and most importantly, increasing model throughput for training and batched inference significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook builds on the process described in the notebook on \"fine-tuning a model on a question-answering task\" `natural-language-processing/other-use-cases/question_answering.ipynb`. In this notebook, we will how to adapt the the `BertForQuestionAnswering` model to accommodate a packed dataset. "

Any remaining space in a pack after the sequences have been concatenated is padded to bring all sequences up to the maximum sequence length.\n",

This, essentially, tells the model where to look from the perspective of a single token, ignoring any encoded information (such as a different sequence) that is not relevant to that token.\n",
    "    - Example of 3 sequences in a pack: `attention_mask = [1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,0,0,0]`\n",
    "    - Compared to a single sequence in an unpacked input `attention_mask = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]`\n",

    "- For SQuAD, during training, answers are determined using a start position and end position within the sequence. During preprocessing, these were converted from character positions to token positions. Now, during packing, as tokenized sequences are effectively being concatenated along the same dimension, the positions of the answer will change for any sequence that is not starting at index 0 within a pack. For example, in a pack with 2 sequences:\n",
