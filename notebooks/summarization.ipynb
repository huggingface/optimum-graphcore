The union are contributing 60% of that contract and the regions are putting Â£1.3m in.\\n\"So it\\'s a total pot of just over Â£3m and if you look at the sorts of salaries that the... guys... have been tempted to go overseas for [are] significant amounts of money.\\n\"So if we were to bring the players back, we\\'d probably get five or six players.\\n\"And I\\'ve always felt - and this is with my rugby hat on now; this is not region or WRU - I\\'d rather spend that money on keeping players in Wales.\\n\"There are players coming out of contract, perhaps in the next year or soâ€¦ you\\'re looking at your Liam Williams\\' of the world; Justin Tipuric for example - we need to keep these guys in Wales.\\n\"We actually want them there. They are the ones who are going to impress the young kids, for example.\\n\"They are the sort of heroes that our young kids want to emulate.\\n\"So I would start off [by saying] with the limited pot of money, we have to retain players in Wales.\\n\"Now, if that can be done and there\\'s some spare monies available at the end, yes, let\\'s look to bring players back.\\n\"But it\\'s a cruel world, isn\\'t it?\\n\"It\\'s fine to take the buck and go, but great if you can get them back as well, provided there\\'s enough money.\"\\nBritish and Irish Lions centre Roberts has insisted he will see out his Racing Metro contract.\\nHe and Phillips also earlier dismissed the idea of leaving Paris.\\nRoberts also admitted being hurt by comments in French Newspaper L\\'Equipe attributed to Racing Coach Laurent Labit questioning their effectiveness.\\nCentre Roberts and flanker Lydiate joined Racing ahead of the 2013-14 season while scrum-half Phillips moved there in December 2013 after being dismissed for disciplinary reasons by former club Bayonne.',\n",
