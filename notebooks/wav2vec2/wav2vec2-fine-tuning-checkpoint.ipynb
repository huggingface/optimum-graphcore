    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "Automatic speech recognition (ASR), the task of transcribing audio automatically, has historically required large amounts of labelled data. Additionally, these systems had predominantly used fixed-feature extraction methods which do not learn from the raw signal, for example, using short-time Fourier transform, or Mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients. Research conducted by Facebook AI (now Meta AI) demonstrates a [framework for self-supervised learning for speech representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.11477). In other words, they demonstrated a pre-training phase and architecture which can learn feature representations, and their relationships, by leveraging large amounts of unlabelled, raw audio data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two phases to training: pre-training on unlabelled data, and fine-tuning on a down-stream task. In the original literature the model is fine-tuned for connectionist temporal classification (CTC), which is an ASR task. The consistent modules between pre-training and fine-tuning are what you’d expect to see in a CTC system; it has feature extraction, and an encoder. But, unlike many models of the past, the feature extraction is a convolutional neural network, which makes it trainable. Following that, there is a BERT-style encoder where a large convolutional block is used before the first layers, rather than using sinusoidal positional encoding.  "
