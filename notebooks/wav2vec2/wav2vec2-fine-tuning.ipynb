    "# wav2vec 2.0 Fine-Tuning on IPU\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to fine-tune a pre-trained wav2vec 2.0 model with PyTorch on the Graphcore IPU-POD16 system. We will use a \"wav2vec2-base\" model and fine-tune for a CTC downstream task using LibriSpeech.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show how to use a wav2vec 2.0 model written in PyTorch from the 🤗`transformers` library from HuggingFace and paralllize it easily using the 🤗`optimum-graphcore` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Background\n",
    "\n",
    "ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition), the task of transcribing audio automatically, has historically required large amounts of labelled data. Additionally, these systems had predominantly used fixed feature extraction methods which do not learn from the raw signal, e.g., STFT, or Mel-Frequency. Research conducted by Facebook AI (now Meta AI) demonstrates a “framework for self-supervised learning for speech representations”. In other words, a pre-training phase and architecture which can learn feature representations, and their relationships, by leveraging large amounts of unlabelled, raw audio data.  \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two phases to training: pre-training on unlabelled data, and fine-tuning on a down-stream task. In the original literature the model is fine-tuned for CTC (connectionist temporal classification), which is an ASR task. The consistent modules between pre-training and fine-tuning are what you’d expect to see in a CTC system; it has feature extraction, and an encoder. But, unlike many models of the past, the feature extraction is a convolutional neural network, which makes it trainable. Following that there is a BERT-style encoder where a large convolutional block is used before the first layers, rather than using sinusoidal positional encoding.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- A Poplar SDK environment enabled (see the [Getting Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide for your IPU system)\n",
    "- Python packages installed with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`"
