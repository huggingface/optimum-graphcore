    "This notebook will demonstrate how to perform wav2vec 2.0 inference with PyTorch on Graphcore IPUs. We will use a `wav2vec2-base` model fine-tuned for a connectionist temporal classification (CTC) downstream task using the [LibriSpeech](https://huggingface.co/datasets/librispeech_asr) dataset.\n",

    "We will show how to use a wav2vec 2.0 model written in PyTorch from the [🤗 Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and parallelize it easily using the [🤗 Optimum Graphcore library](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore). \n",
