    "# wav2vec 2.0 Inference on IPU\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook will demonstrate how to perform wav2vec 2.0 inference with PyTorch on the Graphcore IPU-POD16 system. We will use a `wav2vec2-base` model fine-tuned for a CTC downstream task using LibriSpeech.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will show how to use a wav2vec 2.0 model written in PyTorch from the ðŸ¤—`transformers` library from HuggingFace and paralllize it easily using the ðŸ¤—`optimum-graphcore` library.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environment\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements:\n",
    "- A Poplar SDK environment enabled (see the [Getting Started](https://docs.graphcore.ai/en/latest/getting-started.html) guide for your IPU system)\n",
    "- Python packages installed with `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`"
