    "# Speech Transcription on IPUs using Whisper - Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates speech transcription on the IPU using the [Whisper implementation in the Hugging Face Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/spaces/openai/whisper) alongside [Optimum Graphcore](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore).\n",
    "\n",
    "Whisper is a versatile speech recognition model that can transcribe speech as well as perform multi-lingual translation and recognition tasks.\n",
    "It was trained on diverse datasets to give human-level speech recognition performance without the need for fine tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "[ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore) is the interface between the [ðŸ¤— Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [Graphcore IPUs](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu).\n",
    "It provides a set of tools enabling model parallelization and loading on IPUs, training and fine-tuning on all the tasks already supported by Transformers while being compatible with the Hugging Face Hub and every model available on it out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hardware requirements:** The Whisper models `whisper-tiny`, `whisper-base` and `whisper-small` can run two replicas on the smallest IPU-POD4 machine. The most capable model, `whisper-large`, will need to use either an IPU-POD16 or a Bow Pod16 machine. Please contact Graphcore if you'd like assistance running model sizes that don't work in this simple example notebook.\n",
