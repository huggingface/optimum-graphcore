    "# Speech Transcription on IPUs using Whisper Large - Inference\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook complements the previous [whisper inference notebook](whisper-example.ipynb) so you can run inference on IPUs with the larger configuration of whisper `whisper-large-v2` (1550M parameters).\\\n",
    "Compared to the whisper-large model, the large-v2 model is trained for 2.5x more epochs with added regularization for improved performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whisper is a versatile speech recognition model that can transcribe speech as well as perform multi-lingual translation and recognition tasks.\n",
    "It was trained on diverse datasets to give human-level speech recognition performance without the need for fine tuning. \n",
    "\n",
    "[ðŸ¤— Optimum Graphcore](https://github.com/huggingface/optimum-graphcore) is the interface between the [ðŸ¤— Transformers library](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/index) and [Graphcore IPUs](https://www.graphcore.ai/products/ipu).\n",
    "It provides a set of tools enabling model parallelization and loading on IPUs, training and fine-tuning on all the tasks already supported by Transformers while being compatible with the Hugging Face Hub and every model available on it out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Hardware requirements:**  `whisper-large-v2` has 1550M parameters, it will need to use either an IPU-POD16 or a Bow Pod16 machine. Please contact Graphcore if you'd like assistance running model sizes that don't work in this simple example notebook.\n",
